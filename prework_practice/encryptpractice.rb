#def encrypt_file(filename,rotation)
  # 1) Create the file handle to the input file
#  file = File.open(filename, "r")
  # 2) Read the text of the input file
#  string = file.read
  # 3) Encrypt the text
#  text = encrypt(string, rotation)
  # 4) Create a name for the output file
#  filename = filename + ".encrypted"
  # 5) Create an output file handle
#  encrypted_file = File.open(filename, "w")
  # 6) Write out the text
#  encrypted_file.write(text)
  # 7) Close the file
#  encrypted_file.close
#end

#end

#this works but it comes out as filename.encrypted and doesn't encrypt the message
